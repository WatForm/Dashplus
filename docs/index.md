# Welcome to Dash+

Dash+ is a declarative behavioural modelling language for software-based systems, meaning a model in Dash describes a transition system.  It combines Statecharts-like hierarchical and concurrent control states with the Alloy language for describing guards and actions on individual transitions.  It is an extension of the Alloy language therefore statements in pure Alloy can be combined with the description of the transition system in Dash+.

## Tool Support

Verification tool support (model checking and model instance generation) for Dash+ has been created as an extension to the Alloy Analyzer.  It can be found at: [Dash+ fork of the Alloy Analyzer](https://github.com/WatForm/org.alloytools.alloy)

We also have a simulator for models of Alloy transition systems:
[ALDB](https://github.com/WatForm/aldb)

## Credits and Support

Dash+ was created by Jose Serna and Nancy Day.  It is currently supported by Tamjid Hossain (t7hossain@uwaterloo.ca) and Nancy Day (nday@uwaterloo.ca). Issues with respect to Dash's tool support can be posted on the [Issues page](https://github.com/WatForm/org.alloytools.alloy/issues).  Discussions regarding the language and tool support can be posted on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/WatForm/org.alloytools.alloy/discussions).
